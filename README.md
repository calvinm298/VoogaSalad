August: Worked with Edward to make game data to save and load various authoring and frontend elements to XML using XStream. Made various Authoring GUI frontend components such as the Event pop up window, Duplicate button, GameObject resizing, etc.

### any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project

Java doc resources, XStream, Dropbox API

### files used to start the project (the class(es) containing main)

Main class within the display package

### files used to test the project and errors you expect your program to handle without crashing

You can try out the game by loading enginetestmario in Authoring, or playing Demo308 in Player.

### any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)

Remember to include all necessary .jar files to run the game, such as XStream, reflection packages, and Dropbox API.

### any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)

It is intuitive and has a lot of click and drag. It also uses Groovy for handling behaviors!

### any decisions, assumptions, or simplifications you made to handle vague, ambiguous, or conflicting requirements

We took out a lot of possible flexible features from the Authoring environment to prevent user error. This includes things such as using non letter character keybindings, only one main character, etc.

### any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality

lol

### any extra features included in the project

You can upload and download games to and from Dropbox to share with your friends.

August: Project was really hard, and learned a lot about designing good and flexible code. It does take a lot of time and lots of debugging to get external jar files to work and getting consistent classpaths. Overall a worthy endeavor that made me learn that I don't like programming. However I feel like this project is seminal to the legend of the CS308, so I would be sad if future students got it easier.
