### date you started, date you finished, and an estimate of the number of hours worked on the project

Started: March 20th

Ended: April 29th

Hours worked: 10^2

### each person's role in developing the project

Gouttham: Worked with Trishul, Martin and Yashas to create a game engine. Helped design the engine's code structure as well as implemented specific behaviors, and actions that GameElements can inherit.
Worked on coding the game-flow allowing user to travel from one gameLevel to another. 

Jeffrey:

Calvin: Worked with Jeffrey on the gameplayer. The gameplayer was used in order to initialize our engine and give the user some flexibility 
in terms of what games they want and how they wanted to interact with a game outside of the game itself such as keybindings and volume. Worked
the backend and frontend of this part, but mostly frontend as gameplayer was mainly a frontend thing. Also created two utilities for our group, 
one of which could not be reviewed by Facebook so we can't use it. Did like a couple things for the frontend for authoring. 


Yashas:

Martin: Worked on developing game engine. Developed collision logic, experimented with potential collision utility, created initial testing scenarios, integrated shape behaviors and hitboxes, worked on designing and writing code for game and element events, created old GameMetaData with Gouttham, made design decisions related to integrating game player with engine.

Trishul:

August: Worked with Edward to make game data to save and load various authoring and frontend elements to XML using XStream. Made various Authoring GUI frontend components such as the Event pop up window, Duplicate button, GameObject resizing, etc.

Summer: Maddie and I worked together on the authoring environment. We decided how the back-end should be set up, whether it should use the back-end engine or not, and how the GUIs should look. This would shape the user's game creating experience. In addition, I worked on integrating Groovy into the authoring environment and the engine.

Maddie: Worked with Summer to design the authoring backend; designed and implemented the initial authoring frontend before major refactorings midway through the project; made various authoring frontend components and popup windows

Edward: Works with August Ning to create the game data component of the project. Used XStream based serialization to store data files for game authoring and game engine analysis. Also worked extensively
on authoring component of project with August, Summer, and Maddie.

### any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project

Java doc resources, XStream, Dropbox API, stack overflow, webpage resources

### files used to start the project (the class(es) containing main)

Main class within the display package

### files used to test the project and errors you expect your program to handle without crashing

You can try out the game by loading enginetestmario in Authoring, or playing Demo308 in Player.

### any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)

Remember to include all necessary .jar files to run the game, such as XStream, reflection packages, and Dropbox API.

### any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)

It is intuitive and has a lot of click and drag. It also uses Groovy for handling behaviors!

### any decisions, assumptions, or simplifications you made to handle vague, ambiguous, or conflicting requirements

We took out a lot of possible flexible features from the Authoring environment to prevent user error. This includes things such as using non letter character keybindings, only one main character, etc.

### any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality

lol

### any extra features included in the project

You can upload and download games to and from Dropbox to share with your friends. Possibility for shapes that trace the outside of images, given a super fast computer.

### your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future

Gouttham:

Jeffrey:

Calvin: I think the hardest part of this project was integration, which makes a lot of sense. When we split up into our own groups, we will
naturally have conflicts between parts of the project that we end up having to spend a lot of time fixing. This integration also speaks to
the flexibility of the code. If the code is flexible, then integration shouldn't be a huge issue. Also, I think there could be more strict
guideline for what each group could have accomplished by the demo. Looking back now, I feel like we were behind at the first demo point 
even though I had thought we were pretty on track at the time of the demo. 

Yashas:

Martin: I really enjoyed planning this project, and figuring out how each team would do its part to create a finished product. It really helped solidify my understanding of internal/external APIs, as we had 4 distinct parts of the project that needed to communicate with each other through private channels. Overall, it was fun but very tough.

Trishul:

August: Project was really hard, and learned a lot about designing good and flexible code. It does take a lot of time and lots of debugging to get external jar files to work and getting consistent classpaths. Overall a worthy endeavor that made me learn that I don't like programming. However I feel like this project is seminal to the legend of the CS308, so I would be sad if future students got it easier. 

Summer:

Maddie: This project was obviously very difficult, but I feel like I learned a lot not only about designing good code, but also about teamwork and project management. The open-endedness of the project was pretty intimidating, but I think that it forced us to think harder about how our design would fit together and about the many nuances of the functionality, which was a good learning experience.

Edward: I think that this was a very fun yet extremely challenging project. After working in small groups for both Cell Society and SLogo,
I found it much more difficult to stay organized with a larger team, especially given the magnitude of the task. For this project, good communication is incredibly valuable. 
While I did appreciate the complete flexibility of this project, I think that having suggested goals to achieve by specific times would have been helpful 
(ex. suggested dates by which to complete general authoring, etc.). Furthermore, it may be useful to have students give feedback about the project 
for future students to take advantage of. Code-wise, I think the most difficult aspect was integrating the authoring and engine components. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this project.
